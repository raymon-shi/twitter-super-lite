# twitter-super-lite
I attempted to recreate Twitter using Ruby on Rails. Some features that I've implemented are creating tweets, deleting tweets, following other users, twitter feed and a section for news articles. My web application is hosted on Heroku at: https://rshi-twitter-super-lite.herokuapp.com/
